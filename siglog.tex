\noindent Homotopy type theory is a recently-developed unification of previously disparate frameworks, which can serve to advance the project of formalizing and mechanizing mathematics.  One framework is based on a computational conception of the type of a construction, the other is based on a homotopical conception of the homotopy type of a space.  Indeed, the name ``homotopy type theory'' can be read in two ways, as
``(homotopy type) theory'' and ``homotopy (type theory)'', neatly summarizing the consolidation of ideas at the heart of
the subject.  The computational notion of type has its origins in Brouwer's program of intuitionism, which sought to
ground mathematics in the concept of an effective construction (one would say ``algorithm'' these days).  The
homotopical notion comes from Grothendieck's late conception of the homotopy types of spaces as represented by  $\infty$-groupoids \cite{GrothPS}.  The computational perspective was developed most fully by Per Martin-L\"{o}f, leading in
particular to his Intuitionistic Theory of Types~\cite{mltt}, on which the formal system of homotopy type theory is
based.  The connection to homotopy theory was first hinted at in the groupoid interpretation of Hofmann and
Streicher~\cite{HS,HofmannM:gromtt}.  It was then made explicit by several researchers, roughly simultaneously.\footnote{%
Awodey and Warren~\cite{AW} showed that the basic system of Martin-L\"{o}f type theory can be interpreted in a Quillen model category (an abstract framework for doing homotopy theory); Lumsdaine \cite{L} and van den Berg and Garner \cite{vandenBergB:typwg} showed that every type in the system has the structure of an $\omega$-category (a structure closely related to that of an $\infty$-groupoid); Gambino and Garner \cite{GG} showed that the type theory itself supports a weak factorization system (the basic building block of a Quillen model structure); and both Streicher \cite{StreicherNote} and Voevodsky \cite{VVnote} proposed interpretations into the category of simplicial sets, using ideas from homotopy theory.}
The connection was finally cinched by Voevodsky's introduction of the \emph{univalence axiom}, which is motivated by the homotopical interpretation, and which relates type equality to homotopy equivalence \cite{KLV,APW}.

%\todo[inline,author=RH]{Based on
%  what I got from VV, here we should say that the idea of the homotopy interpretation was in the air already in 2006, as

%Because univalence plays such a central role, Voevodsky has suggested that the unification of the computational and
%homotopical perspectives may be called the \emph{Univalent Framework} unifying two major lines of development in
%mathematics. 
An important point is that this new unification is fully compatible with classical mathematics.  While it does not posit any principles that are incompatible with classical reasoning, it does avoid postulating certain classical axioms that are unnecessary for much of the development. 
Indeed, the formal system of homotopy type theory contains a subsystem with roughly the same power as ZF set theory without the
Axiom of Choice or the Law of the Excluded Middle, two principles that lie at the heart of classical mathematics and that have in the past been obstacles to the kind of unification described here.  By not insisting on these principles as global axioms, it is possible to consider a far richer notion of type than has hitherto been possible in the computational setting, namely one in which types are abstract spaces that can have non-trivial higher-dimensional structure, such as the $n$-spheres for all $n\geq 0$.  Rather than being encoded as structured sets representing a certain conception of space, such as topological space, these objects instead arise \emph{synthetically} within the theory.  They are characterized by their introductory and eliminatory forms (universal properties in the sense of category theory), rather than by how they are constructed as sets. This perspective simplifies some familiar constructions in homotopy theory, such as homotopy groups~\cite{HoTTbook,LS-Circ} 
% truncations~\cite{HoTTbook}, 
and Eilenberg-MacLane spaces~\cite{LF-EM}, and supports new ``logical" proofs 
%\todo[author=RH]{Subjective} 
of some well-known results, such as calculations of the higher homotopy groups of the spheres~\cite{LB-PinSn}.  
In this way it is possible to unify standard, classical logic and set theory, on the one hand, with constructive logic and type theory, on the other, by regarding the former as the logic of a special kind of object (namely, sets), and the latter as the general logic that applies not only to sets, but also to more general spaces.  And, importantly, the now possible formalization of classical mathematics in a constructive system of logic then permits the mechanized verification of these results in computational proof systems based on constructive type theory.
%\todo[inline,author=RH]{Mechanization should be moved earlier as part of the overall UF program.}

What is it that makes this new unification possible?  Although it may be too early to formulate a single, deep
unifying principle, it is possible to make a few observations that will give the reader a sense of its inevitability.
First, all of the constructions of Intuitionistic Type Theory, including especially the previously enigmatic identity
type, are homotopy invariant, in both the  sense that type families and mappings between types inherently respect
``paths'' in spaces, representing \emph{identifications} of points in the space, and that the formation of type-indexed
products and sums of types, which correspond to analogous constructions on spaces, respect the homotopically motivated
notion of type equivelence.  This invariance essentially follows from the basic fact that Martin-L\"{o}f's identity
type corresponds to the \emph{path space} of a space, and since everything in the formal system respects identity, 
everything in the interpretation respects homotopy, which is determined by identification along paths.  Second, a characteristic feature of both intuitionistic type theory and homotopy theory is an emphasis on \emph{structure} over \emph{property}.  Under the propositions-as-types conception of intuitionistic logic,\footnote{See, e.g., \cite{PAT} for a recent survey.} types express propositions, and objects of the type are proofs of those propositions in the form of mathematical constructions that provide evidence for their truth.  A similar emphasis can be discerned  in abstract homotopy
theory, in which, e.g., paths (homotopies) may be seen as evidence for the ``identification" of two
points, and similarly for paths between the corresponding values of two functions.  Two points are not merely ``equal", as a
property, but rather are identified by a (not necessarily unique) deformation, construction, or procedure.  This approach extends to higher
dimensions, in that one may speak of the identifications of two (parallel) identifications, at all higher dimensions.
Such a structure of a hierarchy of identifications via path connectedness is found in standard settings for homotopy
theory such as simplicial sets, cubical sets, and globular sets, all of which stress the role of cells as
identifications.

The hierarchy of possible identifications leads to Voevodsky's conception of a hierarchy of homotopy levels, or h-levels for short, definable within type theory.  Whereas the usual hierarchy of size is determined by type universes or large
cardinals in type theory or set theory, the hierarchy of h-levels is based instead on the internal
structure of a type. 
%\todo[author=RH]{Make all this more precise?}  
Very roughly speaking, the lowest level consists of the types that have at most one element, up to path-connectedness; these are called \emph{propositions}, and they correspond to the (empty or) contractible spaces.  The next level, called \emph{sets}, consists of those types
whose identity types are themselves propositions. After that come the types whose identity types are sets: the \emph{groupoids}.
And so on.  Just the recognition that this hierarchy of h-levels is present in the system of all types has been a huge
advance in our understanding of type theory; previously, it was simply a mystery that some types were fully determined
by their elements, while others seemed to behave as though they had some further structure.  The construction of
quotient types, for example, is now greatly simplified when one knows that the equivalence relation being factored out
is a family of propositions, and not ``higher" types.  For another example, for types $A$ and $B$ that are propositions,
the relevant notion of equivalence is \emph{logical equivalence}, represented by the type $A\leftrightarrow B$.  For
sets, the relevant notion is \emph{isomorphism} $A\cong B$, and for groupoids, there is the notion of
\emph{(categorical) equivalence} $A\simeq B$.  Each of these concepts results by specializing the single, uniform notion
of \emph{equivalence of types} $A\simeq B$ (also due to Voevodsky) to the respective cases of propositions, sets, and groupoids.  

In this setting, the new univalence axiom can be stated as the assertion that the type $A\simeq B$ of all equivalences between
two types $A$ and $B$ is itself equivalent to their identity type,
\[\tag{UA}
(A\simeq B)\ \simeq\  \id{}(A,B).
\]
Thus in particular, logically equivalent propositions will be identified, as in the original, extensional type theory of
Church \cite{Church}.  Isomorphic sets, too, will be identified ``up to homotopy'', \textit{i.e.}, by paths between them in the
universe of all types, and similarly for equivalent groupoids, and equivalent types in general.  Note that this stipulation also serves to specify the otherwise underdetermined identity type $ \id{}(A,B)$.

This is not really the place for a systematic introduction (for that, see \cite{HoTTbook}),  
%or even a general survey (such as \cite{apw,pw}), 
but a brief example may serve to convey a bit of the flavor of the new approach, especially the
distinctive intermingling of logical and homotopical ideas.  As is the case in conventional Martin-L\"of type theory,
the basic types of booleans $\B$ and natural numbers $\N$ can have at most one identification between any two elements;
that is, given say $n, m : \N$ and $p,q: \id{\N}(n,m)$ in the identity type of $n$ and $m$, we always have some
$\alpha:\id{\left(\id{\N}(n,m)\right)}(p,q)$ identifying $p$ and $q$.  In this sense, there is no real information in
the type $\id{\N}(n,m)$, apart from whether or not it is inhabited.  Such types with at most one identification between
any two elements are called ``sets''.  Any types that can be constructed from $\B$,
$\N$, or any other sets, by means of the usual type constructors of dependent sum $\Sigma_{x:A}\,B(x)$ and dependent
product $\Pi_{x:A}\,B(x)$ (which include $A\times B$ and $A\rightarrow B$ as special cases) are also sets, and the same
is true for the equality types $\id{A}(a,a')$ for $a,a':A$, for any set~$A$.

An example of a type that is not a set is the circle (or ``$1$-sphere'') $S^1$, which has a base point $b: S^1$ and a
generating loop $ p :\id{S^1}(b,b)$.  There are then many different self-identifications, which may be labelled:
$$\refl(b),\, p,\, p\cdot p,\, ... :\id{S^1}(b,b),$$ 
Here $\refl(b)$ is the trivial identification, \textit{i.e.}, the
canonical witness to the reflexivity of identity.  There is also the identification $p$, which is different from
$\refl(b)$ in the sense that $\id{\left(\id{S^1}(b,b)\right)}(\refl(b), p)$ is empty.  We can think of $p$ homotopically
as the continuous ``path" that goes once around the circle.

  \end{tikzpicture}
\caption{The 1-sphere $S^1$}\label{fig:s1}
\end{figure}

By the (function witnessing the) transitivity of equality, 
\[
(-)\cdot(-) : \id{S^1}(a,b) \times \id{S^1}(b,c)\to \id{S^1}(a,c),
\]
 there are also the ``paths'' $p\cdot p,\, p\cdot p\cdot p,\, \ldots$.   And by symmetry,
 \[
 (-)^{-1}:\id{S^1}(a,b) \to \id{S^1}(b,a),
 \]
 there are similarly the paths $p^{-1},\, p^{-1}\cdot p^{-1}, \ldots :\id{S^1}(b,b)$.  Although $S^1$ is therefore not a set, it can be shown that $\id{S^1}(b,b)$ is one; that is, the types $\id{\left(\id{S^1}(b,b)\right)}(x,y)$ are either inhabited (by reflexivities) or empty, depending on whether or not $x=y$, for all $x,y : \id{S^1}(b,b)$.  Indeed, one can show that $\id{S^1}(b,b) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, \textit{i.e.}, the fundamental group of the type $S^1$ is the integers, as it should be \cite{LS-Circ}.  
% In a situation like this, where the $\id{}$-type is always a set, we say that $S^1$ is a ``(homotopy) 1-type".  
The proof of this uses the univalence axiom, together with the specification of $S^1$ as a new kind of \emph{higher} inductive type, generalizing the usual inductive specification of the natural numbers and similar structures.  For $S^1$, the inductive specification essentially says that $S^1$ is the type freely generated by the base point $b:S^1$ and the loop $p:\id{S^1}(b,b)$, in the same sense that the usual inductive specification of $\N$ says that it is the type freely generated by $0:\N$ and the successor function $s:\N\to\N$.  
  
Another type that is not a set is the universe $\U$ of all (small) types.  According to the Univalence Axiom, identifications between types $A,B:\U$ correspond to equivalences $A\simeq B$, which as we said above are generalized type isomorphisms.  In fact, as already stated, if $A$ and $B$ themselves are sets, then an equivalence between them is just an isomorphism in the usual sense: a pair of maps back and forth that compose to the respective identity mapppings.  Now the booleans $\B$, for example, have two different isomorphisms $\B\simeq \B$, namely the identity and the operation of ``negation'' $\neg:\B\to\B$, which swaps the truth values $0,1:\B$.  Thus by univalence there are two distinct identifications in $\id{\U}(\B,\B)$, corresponding to these distinct isomorphisms, and so $\U$ is not a set, but, like $S^1$, a ``higher-dimensional" type.  
 
Now observe that by the basic recursive property of $S^1$ as ``the type freely generated by a point with a loop on it'', there is a map $$\rec(\B,n): S^1 \to \U,$$ determined by sending the base point $b:S^1$ to the booleans $\B:\U$ and the generating loop $p : \id{S^1}(b,b)$ to (the loop corresponding under univalence to) negation, say $n : \id{\U}(\B,\B)$.  As a type of the form $S^1\to\U$, this $\rec(\B,n)$ is thus a family of types over $S^1$, sometimes called a ``dependent type" and written $x:S^1 \vdash \rec(\B,n)(x)$.  Homotopically, such a type-family is interpreted as a ``fibration" $E\to S^1$, where the total space $E$ is just the sum type $\Sigma_{x:S^1}\,\rec(\B,n)(x)$, equipped with its usual indexing projection.  In the present case, the ``fiber" is then the type $\rec(\B,n)(b) = \B$, and the action on (elements of) $\B$ induced by the path $n: \id{S^1}(b,b)$ in the base is exactly the operation of negation $\neg : \B\to \B$.  Thus, from a homotopical point of view, we have constructed the ``twisted double cover'' of the circle (see Figure \ref{fig:winding}).

This construction from homotopy theory is closely related to the celebrated Hopf fibration which, among other things, can be used to compute some of the higher homotopy groups of the spheres $S^2$ and $S^3$.  Indeed, one can construct the Hopf fibration in homotopy type theory in much the same way as the foregoing example, using univalence, negation, winding around the circle, and other constructions derived from combinations of logical, type-theoretic, and homotopical ideas (see \cite{HoTTbook}, \S 8.5). 

% This sort of reasoning gives an entirely new ``synthetic" approach to some areas of classical mathematics like algebraic topology, which not only allows for the explicit logical formalization of classical results like the calculations of homotopy groups of spheres, but also permits their formal verification in computational proof systems based on a constructive system of logic.

% the following bit expands on some of the material in 107-129, but also conflicts with it in some places 
% (e.g. "n-type" vs. "h-level").
% I have tried below to revise to avoid some repetition and make it more consistent, but this is just a suggestion.
% I am leaving the original here in comments for comparison and possible reuse.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%An important point about univalent foundations is that it subsumes the classical set-theoretic framework for doing
%mathematics.  The hierarchy of $n$-types neatly accounts for classical set-theoretic foundations within a broader
%framework of homotopy types.  Specifically, $-1$-types, which have at most one element up to higher identification,
%correspond to classical proof-irrelevant propositions, except that whether to insist that every proposition be inhabited
%or empty remains a consistent choice that one may accept or reject at will.  The $0$-types, for which equality is a
%classical proposition ($-1$-type) that is taken to be ``self-evident'' or ``proof-irrelevant'' correspond to classical
%sets, without prior commitment to choice principles or whether membership is a boolean proposition; these can be taken
%as axioms according to preference, without fear of inconsistency.  The advantage of univalent foundations is that
%besides the familiar concepts of proposition (classically formalized as predicate calculus) and set (classically given
%by the Zermelo-Fr\"{a}nkel axioms), it provides an infinite hierarchy of dimensions extending beyond just these two.
%For example, the $1$-types are the natural setting for set-theoretic structures, such as groups or rings, that one may
%wish to identify up to isomorphism.  Because two groups, say, can be isomorphic in different ways, the evidence for
%their identification must provide the mutually inverse pairs of homomorpisms that constitute the identification.
%
%Another import aspect of univalent foundations is that it extends Martin-L\"{o}f's type theory~\cite{mltt} with an
%infinite hierarchy of dimensions that were hitherto inaccessible within the theory, even though models were known that
%exhibited higher-dimensional structure~\cite{HS}.  Type theory was conceived as a foundation for
%constructive mathematics, in which all constructions, including proofs of propositions, have direct computational
%meaning in accordance with Brouwer's original program.  This connection with computation has proved enormously
%influential in computer science, in particular in the theory of programming languages and the foundations of mechanized
%proof.  At present homotopy type theory exploits the concept of proof relevance that is central to the constructivist
%program (indeed, according to that program propositions are not just $-1$-types, but can be any $n$-type), and draws on
%the emphasis on abstract types (for example, in the treatment of the identification type as an abstraction in itself,
%rather than being encoded in terms of a concrete conception of homotopy).  The grand challenge is to extend the
%computational interpretation to the full hierarchy of $n$-types, providing a computational meaning for, say, mappings
%among higher-dimensional structures such as the spheres and toruses of arbitrary dimension.  Recent advances, such as
%the development of a constructively valid model using cubical sets~\cite{BCH}, strongly suggest that such a unification
%is possible in the near future.  The implications for computer science are only beginning to be
%explored~\cite{patch-theory}.
%
%It is a curious fact, made all the more interesting by the above-mentioned developments, that two of the most successful
%systems for mechanized proof, NuPRL~\cite{nuprl-book} and Coq~\cite{coq}, are based on constructive type theory.  Why
%ought that be the case?  Univalent foundations seems to provide a clue, namely the importance of proof-relevance for
%both classical homotopy theory and constructive mathematics.  A significant contribution of homotopy type theory is that

We can now say in a bit more detail how the univalent framework of homotopy type theory subsumes and extends the classical, set-theoretic
framework for doing mathematics, by making use of the hierarchy of h-levels, which includes sets within a broader
framework of homotopy types.  At the bottom level, the propositions (the types having at most one element, up to higher
identification) correspond to conventional, proof-irrelevant propositions; whether we also assert the law of excluded middle in the form that every such proposition is either inhabited or empty is a further, consistent assumption that may be made if classical logic is desired.  Next, the
sets (for which equality is a proposition that is taken to be ``self-evident'' or ``proof-irrelevant'')
correspond to the usual sets, but now without any commitment to choice principles, or whether membership is a boolean
proposition.  Those further principles can still be consistently taken as axioms if needed, but they are not required, even with the introduction of infinite sets such as the type of natural numbers. Voevodsky's new insight, which plays such an important role in homotopy type theory, is that, besides the familiar concepts of proposition (classically formalized in predicate
calculus) and set (classically given by the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms), there is an infinite hierarchy of further
dimensions extending beyond just these two.  The groupoids (the next h-level above the sets), such as our example $S^1$, are the natural setting for systems of set-theoretic structures, such as groups and rings, that one may wish to regard as identified up to
isomorphism.  Because two groups, say, can be isomorphic in many different ways, however, the evidence for an
identification is not a trivial proposition, but consists in the mutually inverse pair of homomorpisms, \textit{i.e.}, the
isomorphism, that warrant it.

In this way we can now distinguish, within Martin-L\"{o}f type theory, an infinite hierarchy of different ``homotopical dimensions" that were not fully recognized previously, despite such models as Hofmann and Streicher's two-dimensional groupoid interpretation~\cite{HS} that strongly hinted at the importance of higher-dimensions of structure.
%\todo[author=RH]{Note rephrasing.}  
Type theory was of course originally conceived
as a foundation for constructive mathematics, in which all constructions, including proofs of propositions, have direct
computational meaning in accordance with Brouwer's original program.  This fundamental connection with computation has
proved enormously influential in computer science, in particular in the theory of programming languages and the
foundations of mechanized proof.  Homotopy type theory makes esential use of the concept of proof relevance that is so
central to the constructive program and emphasizes a notion of abstract types familiar from the theory of programming
languages (\textit{e.g.}, the identification type is itself an abstraction, rather than being encoded in terms of a
concrete conception of homotopy).  The grand challenge at this point is to extend the computational interpretation to
the full hierarchy of h-levels, providing a computational meaning for, say, mappings among higher-dimensional structures
such as the spheres and toruses of arbitrary dimension.  Recent advances, such as the development of a constructively
valid model using cubical sets~\cite{BCH}, strongly suggest that such a unification will be achieved in the near future.
The potential implications for computer science are only beginning to be explored~\cite{AMLH}.

Perhaps the most important application of the unification of classical and constructive mathematics is the possibility of
applying systems of mechanized proof verification to broad swaths of classical mathematics that were previously
formalizable only via elaborate coding into set theory, and only in systems based on classical logic, which generally
lack the benefits resulting from the computational interpretation of constructive systems (\textit{e.g.}, the generation of
independently verifiable proof certificates).  The direct formalization of everything from quotient sets to cohomology simplifies 
and streamlines the formalization of even advanced mathematics, and has the
potential to eventually make formal verification into a practical tool for the everyday mathematician.  Interestingly,
this practical development makes the logical foundations of mathematics finally relevant to the actual practice of
mathematics, rather than being just a theoretical possibility.  The result may be a new ``post-G\"odel" attitude toward
logical foundations; for when their only interest was theoretical, the phenomenon of incompleteness seemed to lessen the
importance of logical foundations in principle.  But with the actual practical benefits of formalization (increased
rigor and certainty, ease of remote collaboration, accumulation of results), the theoretical incompleteness phenomenon
diminishes in importance, and logical foundations can become a useful tool in the toolbox of the working mathematician.

%\todo[author=RH]{Not sure the preceding belongs here, but could perhaps by merged into what follows, and moved earlier

It is a curious fact, made all the more interesting by the above-mentioned developments, that two of the most successful
systems for mechanized proof, NuPRL~\cite{NuPRL} and Coq~\cite{Coq}, are both based on constructive type theory.  Why
ought that be the case?  Homotopy type theory may provide a clue in the importance of proof-relevance, and the
associated distinction between property and structure, in both constructive mathematics and homotopy theory.
The univalent approach of homotopy type theory exploits the axiomatic freedom provided by constructive mathematics, allowing it to rely far less on elaborate encodings which impede the process of formalization required to admit machine-checked proof.  This experience parallels the development of high-level (abstract) programming languages that provide a synthetic concept of computation, rather than one based on
low-level machine models such as the Turing machine or Random-Access Machine.  Thus we find that whether we are
discussing mechanized mathematical proof or verified computer programming, Church's $\lambda$-calculus emerges as a
central concept.  Perhaps this explains why constructive mathematics and mechanized proof are so tightly linked.  That
they should also be entwined with homotopy theory --- one of the most abstract, geometrical, and rarified areas of
modern mathematics --- is an intriguing and challenging fact inviting further investigation.
